# Prompt journal

Use this document to record the various prompts sent to GPT-3 with some notes about how well they did or didn't work. Keep the following taxonomy in mind:

* `zero-shot`: prompts given _without any_ examples
* `few-shot`: prompts given _with a few_ examples
* `many-shot`: prompts provided with _a plethora_ of examples

Also, think a bit about which kinds of prompts are best for which constraints. For example, how do `few-shot` and `many-shot` prompts help a constraint such as "Larding" or "Inventory" (among others)?
